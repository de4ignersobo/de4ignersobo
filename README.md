## Hi~ I'am BXÂ·BI designerðŸ‘‹

:blush: I mainly work on brand experience and brand identity (BX/BI), but I also do typography, video editing, poster design, shooting with Sony and Canon cameras, and basic 3D modeling. Additionally, Iâ€™m self-studying HTML and CSS.

:blue_heart: I'm interested in public institution branding, bid proposal PPTs, urban regeneration, local communities, and volunteer work.
